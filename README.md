## bioTrac
A quick and dirty r-shiny web app for Genomic Innovation class final. The idea is to track diet, symptoms, and microbiome composition of IBD patients so as to make predictions about potential flare-ups and make lifestyle recommendations

**NOTE** All data and code for plotting composition has been shamelessly lifted from this very helpful [repository](https://github.com/knights-lab/dietstudy_analyses) which is based on this excellent [paper](https://www.cell.com/cell-host-microbe/pdfExtended/S1931-3128(19)30250-1)
